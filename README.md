# PyCaret Tool
PyCaret is an open source machine learning library in Python that trains and deploys machine learning models in a low-code environment. PyCaret can be integrated within Power BI, thus allowing analysts and data scientists to add a layer of machine learning to their Dashboards and Reports without any additional license or software costs. PyCaret is an open source and free to use Python library that comes with a wide range of functions that are exclusively built to work within Power BI.

### how to implement the following in Power BI:
* Clustering — Group data points with similar characteristics.

* Anomaly Detection — Identify rare observations / outliers in the data.

* Natural Language Processing — Analyze text data via topic modeling.

* Association Rule Mining — Find interesting relationships in the data.

* Classification — Predict categorical class labels that are binary (1 or 0).

* Regression — Predict continuous value such as Sales, Price etc.

**“PyCaret is democratizing machine learning and the use of advanced analytics by providing free, open source, and low-code machine learning solution for business analysts, domain experts, citizen data scientists, and experienced data scientists”.**
